# fischertechnik-3D-robot-webcam-gestures-system
This repository contains the project for the subject "Industrial Automation And Robotics".

The aim of the project is to interact with the fishertechnik 3D arm robot (https://www.fischertechnik.de/en/products/simulating/training-models/511938-sim-3d-robot-24v-simulation) through a webcam gestures detection system.

The start point of this project is the system developed by @Giorgionocera and @gabryk9 in the repository https://github.com/Giorgionocera/fischertechnik-3D-robot, in which they programmed the communication between a computer and the PLC of the robotic arm.
